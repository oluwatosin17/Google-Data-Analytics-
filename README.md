### Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere
- what exactly is data? Well, I like to say that data
is a collection of facts. This collection can
include numbers, pictures, videos, words, measurements,
observations, and more. Once you have data, analytics puts it to work through analysis. Data analysis is the
collection, transformation, and organization of data in
order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive
informed decision-making. It doesn't stop there. Data evolves over time, which means this
analysis or analytics, as we call it, can give us new information throughout
data's entire life cycle. Data is everywhere. You use and create data everyday.

- a data analyst
is someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to help make
informed decisions. 

- For businesses to be on
top of the competition, they need to be on top of their data. That's why these companies hire data
analysts to control the waves of data they collect every day, makes sense of it, and
then draw conclusions or make predictions. This is the process of turning
data into insights, and it's how analysts help businesses
put all their data to good use. This is actually a good way to think about
analysis: turning data into insights. As a reminder, the more detailed
definition you learned earlier is that data analysis is the collection,
transformation, and organization of data in
order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and
drive informed decision-making. So after analysts have created
insights from data, what happens? Well, a lot. Those insights are shared with others,
decisions are made, and businesses take action.

**Case Study: New data perspectives**
Here’s a real-life example of how one group of data analysts used the six steps of the data analysis process to improve their workplace and its business processes. Their story involves something called people analytics — also known as human resources analytics or workforce analytics. People analytics is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company’s workforce in order to gain insights to improve how the company operates.
Being a people analyst involves using data analysis to gain insights about employees and how they experience their work lives. The insights are used to define and create a more productive and empowering workplace. This can unlock employee potential, motivate people to perform at their best, and ensure a fair and inclusive company culture. 
The six steps of the data analysis process that you have been learning in this program are:
 - ask,
 - prepare, 
 - process, 
 - analyze, 
 - share, and
 - act.
- These six steps apply to any data analysis. 

- An organization was experiencing a high turnover rate among new hires. Many employees left the company before the end of their first year on the job.
The analysts used the data analysis process to answer the following question: how can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees? 

Let’s break down what this team did, step-by-step. 

 - #### Ask
- First up, the analysts in our example needed to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. So, to determine these things, they asked effective questions and collaborated with leaders and managers who were interested in the outcome of their people analysis.  

#### Prepare
- It all started with solid preparation. The group built a timeline of three months and decided how they wanted to relay their progress to interested parties. Also during this step, the analysts identified what data they needed to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step - in this case, the analysts chose to gather the data from a survey of new employees. They identified specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction with different business processes, such as hiring, onboarding, and compensation. Rules were established for who would have access to the data collected, what specific information would be gathered, and how best to present the data visually. The analysts brainstormed possible project- and data-related issues and how to avoid them. 

#### Process
- The group sent the survey out. Great analysts know how to respect both their data and the people who provide it. Since employees provided the data, it was important to make sure all employees gave their consent to participate. The data analysts also made sure employees understood how their data would be collected, stored, managed, and protected. In order to maintain confidentiality and protect and store the data effectively, access was restricted to a limited number of analysts. Collecting and using data ethically is one of the responsibilities of a data analyst. Then the data was cleaned up to make sure it was complete, correct, and relevant, and uploaded to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security. 

#### Analyze
- Then, the analysts did what they do best: analyze! From the completed surveys, the data analysts would discover that a new employee’s experience with the hiring process was a key indicator of overall job satisfaction. The analysts found that employees who experienced an efficient and transparent hiring process were most likely to remain with the company. Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process were most likely to leave the company. The group knew it was important to document exactly what they found in the analysis, no matter what the results. To do otherwise would decrease trust in the survey process and reduce their ability to collect truthful data from employees in the future. 

#### Share
- Just as they made sure the data was carefully protected, the analysts were also careful sharing the report. For example, in order for a manager to receive the survey report, a minimum number of their team members had to have participated in the survey. The group presented the results to leaders first to make sure they had the full picture, then asked them to deliver the results to their teams. This gave leaders an opportunity to communicate the results with the right context and have productive team conversations about next steps. 

#### Act
- The last stage of the process for the team of analysts was to work with leaders within their company and decide how best to implement changes and take actions based on the findings. The analysts recommended standardizing the hiring process for all new hires based on the most efficient and transparent hiring practices. A year later, the same survey was distributed to employees. Analysts anticipated that a comparison between the two sets of results would indicate that the action plan worked. Turns out, the changes improved the retention rate for new employees and the actions taken by leaders were successful! 

**Is people analytics right for you?**
One of the many things that makes data analytics so exciting is that the problems are always different, the solutions need creativity, and the impact on others can be great — even life-changing or life-saving. As a data analyst, you can be part of these efforts. Maybe you’re even inspired to learn more about the field of people analytics. If so, consider learning more about this field and adding that research to your data analytics journal. You never know: One day soon, you could be helping a company create an amazing work environment for you and your colleagues!

**What is the data ecosystem?** 
- an ecosystem is a group
of elements that interact with one another. Ecosystems can be large, data lives inside its own ecosystem too. Data ecosystems are made up of various
elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store,
organize, analyze, and share data. These elements include hardware and
software tools, and the people who use them.  Data can also be found in
something called the cloud. The cloud is a place to keep data online,
rather than on a computer hard drive. So instead of storing data somewhere
inside your organization's network, that data is accessed over the internet. So the cloud is just a term we use
to describe the virtual location. The cloud plays a big part in the data
ecosystem, and as a data analyst, it's your job to harness the power of that data
ecosystem, find the right information, and provide the team with analysis
that helps them make smart decisions. For example, you could tap into
your retail store's database, which is an ecosystem filled
with customer names, addresses, previous purchases, and customer reviews. As a data analyst, you could use this
information to predict what these customers will buy in the future, and make sure the store has the products
and stock when they're needed. As another example, let's think about a data ecosystem
used by a human resources department. This ecosystem would include information
like postings from job websites, stats on the current labor market, employment rates, and social media
data on prospective employees. A data analyst could use this information
to help their team recruit new workers and improve employee engagement and
retention rates. But data ecosystems aren't just for stores
and offices. They work on farms, too. Agricultural companies regularly
use data ecosystems that include information including geological
patterns in weather movements. Data analysts can use this data to
help farmers predict crop yields. Some data analysts are even using
data ecosystems to save real environmental ecosystems. At the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography, coral reefs all over the world are monitored digitally, so they
can see how organisms change over time, track their growth, and
measure any increases or declines in individual colonies. 

- one common misconceptions you might come across. First is the difference between
data scientists and data analysts. It's easy to confuse the two, but
what they do is actually very different. Data science is defined as
creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown
by using raw data. Here's a good way to think about it. Data scientists create new questions
using data, while analysts find answers to existing questions by
creating insights from data sources. ome common
